Therefore, the test measures the ability to draw inductive logical conclusions (inductive logical reasoning). The concentrated analysis of information and data bases and the recognition of rules behind them is vitally important in certain occupational areas.</p></span><span><p><b>How to interpret your result</b><br><br>
Your performance score has been calculated out of your correct and incorrect indications on the grid. Please consider that this is only a snapshot of your performance which can be influenced by various factors. Your performance in the test can be described as follows:
</p></span><span><p>Compared to other participants, it is <b>harder</b> for you to handle the tasks in this test successfully. </p></span><span><p><b>What is your processing style like?</b><br><br>
In addition to the performance score your processing style is measured. It indicates how many questions you completed in the default time (speed) and how many of those questions you answered correctly (accuracy). These two scores are compared with the scores of other participants as well.&nbsp;The optimal processing style is to complete as many questions as possible, as accurately as possible.</p></span><span><p></p><div style="margin-right:150px;text-align:right;margin-bottom:10px;font-weight:bold;">Questions in the test:&nbsp;12<br>Number of completed questions (speed):&nbsp;9<br>Number of questions correctly answered (accuracy):&nbsp;6<br></div><p></p></span><span><p>Your processing style can be characterised as follows:</p></span><span><p>Your completion of the test was <b>rather slow</b>, this means that you completed fewer tasks than most other people in the default time. You also tended to be <b>inaccurate</b> which means that, compared to other participants, you made many mistakes.</p></span><div class="report-footer"><div class="copyright">Copyright © 2018 cut-e Group | cut-e and the cut-e logo are trademarks of cut-e Group</div><div class="pager pagenumber">    Page 1 / 3</div></div></div>

The recognition and understanding of rules and relations is a complex cognitive process. The personal thinking style is built early on the basis of one’s own genetic fundamentals and the experienced support and can later only gradually but not basically be changed anymore. Nevertheless, much can be done to tap one’s full potential. If you are dissatisfied with your results in this test you’ll find some tips here that might help you to improve yourself.<br>

<li>Buy a magazine with brain puzzles containing tasks like continuing number sequences, complete matrices or eliminate the improper term out of a sequence of terms. Complete some of these tasks regularly. 
</li><li>Consider „dissimilar“ things deeply and find out in which aspects they are the same or similar (e.g. what do a monkey and a banana have in common?). 
</li><li>Consider „similar“ things deeply and find out in which aspects they are completely different (e.g. in which aspects differ „light“ and „shine“?).</li></ul><p></p></span><span><div id="div_Norm" class="WorkStyleNorm textsmall" style="position: absolute; bottom: 40px; right: 1px;"><b><b>Norm group:</b></b>&nbsp;General adult population<br></div></span><div class="report-footer"><div class="copyright">Copyright © 2018 cut-e Group | cut-e and the cut-e logo are trademarks of cut-e Group</div><div class="pager pagenumber">    Page 2 / 3</div></div></div>
